# DUAL EX DISPLAYS 3U PANEL

Kicad files for a 14 HP 3U Eurorack panel to mount a pair of 2.3" 128x32 OLED displays compatible with the Expert Sleepers [Disting EX](https://www.expert-sleepers.co.uk/distingEX.html).


Designed for part no [TW28320230B](https://www.google.com/search?q=TW28320230B01) by Topwin, other displays may be physically compatible.

The zip file in the Gerbers/ folder contains all the files required to order a PCB panel: 

Download this [file](https://github.com/minisystem/ex_displays/blob/main/Gerbers/ex_displays.zip) and submit to your favourite board house. We used 1.6 MM aluminum PCBs, but you may also order in FR4 material.

The panel cutouts are designed to follow the outline of the display's metal bezel, allowing them to sit flush with the panel surface with the right standoffs. The mounting holes are compatible with 2-56 or M2.5 mounting hardware. Standoffs with a between board height range of 2-3 MM are required. We wound up stacking a pair of nylon 2-56 nuts.
